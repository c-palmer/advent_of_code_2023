# Advent of Code 2023

Most of my solutions will be written in JavaScript.

For each day I plan on including the following files:
- A text file called input.txt containing the input for that day
- a part_1 and part_2 file containing the code for part 1 and 2 of each day's puzzle respectively
- a text file containing the psudocode I write before attempting to write any code

I would also like to record the following aspects of my problem solving journey, but don't really know how to document it yet:
- My thought process along the way, kind of like a journal
- problems I ran into, edge cases I didn't account for, misc things future me would be confused by, etc
- a list of new syntax, data structures, methods, algorithms, etc that I discovered along the way and an explaination of each
- any older versions of a solution
