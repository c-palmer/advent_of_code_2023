Old way:
    simulation problem

    simulate O's rolling north:
        store board in 2D array
        iterate over each item in array and apply simulation rules
        tilt north rule:
            for every O, if there is a . located above, swap
            apply rule until applying the rule results in no change

    calculuate number:
        reduce every row of 2D array to the number of O's in the row
        reverse array
        reduce array by multiplying element by its index + 1

New way:
    turn input into array of strings
    transpose grid so that each column is a row
