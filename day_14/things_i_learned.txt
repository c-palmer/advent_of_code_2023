I had an array of strings and I was thinking about it as a 2D array, but in javascript strings are immutable
I was trying to change characters in the string like so:
    let str = 'hello';
    str[0] = 'c';
    console.log(str);
this outputs 'hello' instead of 'cello'. Instead, you should turn the string into an array first:
    let str = 'hello';
    str = str.split('');
    str[0] = 'c';
    str = str.join('\n');
    console.log(str);
will now output 'cello'
