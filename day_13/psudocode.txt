break grid up into rows
transpose grid and break that up into rows (these are the cols)

start by comparing row 1 and row 2  of original grid to see if they are equal
set multiplier to 100 for original row case
    if not, increment both pointers by one to look at next pair of rows
    if they match
        take note of the values of the first and second pointer
        decriment the first pointer and increment the second
            if the first pointer is decrimented to -1
            or the second pointer is incremented to # rows + 1
                reflection point was found
if reflection was not found in original grid, search transpose in the same way 
set multiplier to 1 for transpose case
